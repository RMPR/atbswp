# Use cases
While I've mainly used it to automate my Asphalt runs, I think this can be far more useful:
- automate a demo during a conference for example
- automate UAT in the devops process (as long as you're making something with a GUI).

If you use it for something really cool you can always reach me at akoudanilo(at) gmail (dot) com or drop
a PR :). Bonus points if you have a demo video.

On Linux, this only works with Xorg, with wayland support coming soon, for now you have to
enable Xorg.
